This post will try to encourage you to get started with cross-platform development, starting from your own Gatsby blog.

You probably heard of [React-Native-Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web), allowing to render React-Native views on the web. So, why not on a static website?

I'll show that it's possible (and actually pretty easy) to embed runnable React-Native code inside a Gatsby blog post. I really hope all React-Native developers owning a Gatsby blog will do so. You will find demos and code samples at the end.

# The state of cross-platform in 2020

React-Native now has a [lean core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313). Somehow, [Expo](https://expo.io/) can be seen as an extension of the React-Native SDK: it offers a much larger API surface, enabling richer experiences.

These last years, the Expo team (particularly [Evan Bacon](https://twitter.com/baconbrix)) has done a great work to bring support for web to many of its APIs, and new APIs tend to be crafted with the web platform in mind.
Expo created [@expo/webpack-config](@expo/webpack-config), a default Webpack config that enables you to get started with React-Native-Web ASAP (without configuring babel loader, enabling the `.web.js` extension, adding svg support...).

It's also worth mentioning that Microsoft is developing [React-Native for Windows and MacOS](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/), and is actively collaborating with Facebook. New React-Native abstractions also try to take into consideration desktop applications.
They are also developing [ReactXP](https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/), an alternative solution to React-Native-Web, with a smaller and reworked API surface (only 11 primitive components).
I wouldn’t be surprised to see Facebook/Microsoft come up with a new mobile OS, running React-Native natively (it could run all existing apps for free, with minor adaptations, and with better performance than iOS/Android). That could explain why Microsoft invests in React-Native for MacOS, as it would give developers more incentives to use React-Native, and bring desktop support to it.

Flutter is also very interesting, but they have an even larger ecosystem to build to succeed, while React-Native can more easily reuse existing JS tooling. For example, it's unlikely to see this year a static site generators in Dart at the level of Gatsby or NextJS. Being able to render an UI is not the whole story, to enable enterprise production-ready Flutter on the web, they'll also have to tackle the distribution/packaging of apps.

The future of cross-platform development looks bright to me. For Windows and Mac, it's a bit early, but it's really time to adopt cross-platform for the web.

# React-Native, Expo and Gatsby

I'm the maintainer of [gatsby-plugin-react-native-web](https://github.com/slorber/gatsby-plugin-react-native-web), and pleased to announce **version 3.0 is now out of beta**, and uses under the hood `@expo/webpack-config`.
You only need to add the plugin to `gatsby-config.js`, and **nothing else is required** to get started (no plugin config to provide).

Your favorite ReactNative libs and UI kits should work out of the box.
There might still be a few edge cases (please [report them](https://github.com/slorber/gatsby-plugin-react-native-web/issues/)), but I'm confident it's now ready for massive adoption.


------------------------------------------------



# Call to action


### You are a React-Native, Expo developer?


It's time to embed some real, runnable React-Native code in your blog posts. And yes, it works with [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), with a Gatsby theme (like [mine](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela)!), with [Docz](https://www.docz.site/)...

You can do this with [NextJS](https://dev.to/evanbacon/next-js-expo-and-react-native-for-web-3kd9) too. [Evanbacon.dev](http://evanbacon.dev/) is build with NextJS and Expo. But really, you can use [@expo/webpack-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/webpack-config) on any project using Webpack.

If you have an Expo app, it's also time to try the `expo build --web` command.
This is certainly the easiest to get started, but we haven't really figured out a good cross-platform navigation system. React-Navigation might support web, but mobile and desktop navigation patterns are simply different beasts, and it's hard to find a good abstraction.


### You are a web developer?

I still encourage you to try this plugin, just to get a better idea about what React-Native-Web is.

Even if you don't aim to share code between web and mobile, React-Native-Web can be seen as a low-level UI kit, including its own performant CSS-in-JS system, with a few interesting specificities like [atomic CSS](http://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/?path=/docs/guides-style--page#implementation-details).
It's so good, Twitter choose it for their mobile and desktop websites, despite not using ReactNative on mobile.
Facebook also hired React-Native-Web author [Nicolas Gallagher](https://twitter.com/necolas), and the new Facebook (in beta) is using a proprietary/unreleased atomic CSS framework (XStyle?).
This atomic CSS strategy has been reported to scale extremely well for large websites (see this [React Conf 2019 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JZHodNR184)).

It has also been speculated that [React-Native might simply become a better choice for building websites than React-DOM](https://www.swyx.io/writing/react-native-web-singularity/). I don't think it's the case today though, but share this idea.


### You are a lib author?

It's time to seriously think about cross-platform development.
What if your lib could be used everywhere, instead of just the web OR mobile?

Apart from Expo, React-Native core, and a few React-Native UI kits, there is a lack of quality cross-platform components for rich experiences (toasts, maps, credit card inputs...).
[expo-dark-mode-switch](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-dark-mode-switch) is a good cross-platform component example. Using [expo-module-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-module-scripts) might help you publish something.

Publishing cross-platform  libraries might become as important for consumers as publishing a library with type definitions.
Think about how annoying it is when you want to use a JS library but find out it does not have TypeScript definitions?
Or when you want to use a JS library in Node, but find out it unnecessarily depends on some global browser object? In the future, not publishing cross-platform React widgets might create the same level of frustration. I think it's time to make the cross-platform ecosystem great, and the Expo team show us the way.

# Demo time


**Warning**: the web support of these demos is not perfect (particularly browser support).
As the community around cross-platform grows (thanks to you!), these issues will be resolved.

**For a better experience, please try with Chrome**.

These demos may not look very impressive for a web developer. Keep in mind they are all written with React-Native and Expo components / apis.
There's no usage of a single `div` in the codebase here, nor any browser API usage, without going through an intermediate layer of React-Native components.

All these demos can also run in iOS and Android (natively, of course), for which the support is really good.


import {
  ExpoCameraDemo,
  ExpoDarkModeSwitchDemo,
  ExpoGesturesDemo,
  ExpoSvgDemo,
  ExpoVideoDemo,
  ExpoImagePickerDemo,
} from './components';


------------------------------------------------

So, let's start with a simple one.

Can I render a complex svg with react-native-svg? Yes!

<ExpoSvgDemo />


------------------------------------------------


Can I use a cross-platform component, like [expo-dark-mode-switch](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-dark-mode-switch), and wire it to my Gatsby theme-ui state? Yes!

<ExpoDarkModeSwitchDemo />

------------------------------------------------



Can I ask your permission to use your camera, and reveal it with a fade-in animation? Yes!

<ExpoCameraDemo />

------------------------------------------------


Can I use more complex gesture-based systems? Yes!

<ExpoGesturesDemo />



Can I play a video? Yes!

<ExpoVideoDemo />

------------------------------------------------


Can I build an image picker, and enable a few image transformations? Yes!

<ExpoImagePickerDemo />

------------------------------------------------

In case you wonder what the code looks like, here's a snippet for the camera demo.

You can find the rest of the code [here](https://github.com/slorber/sebastienlorber.com/tree/master/content/posts/2020-04-21-using-expo-and-gatsby-together).

```jsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';

import MobilePhoneView from 'components/MobilePhoneView';
import AppButton from 'components/designSystem/AppButton';
import AppRevealView from 'components/designSystem/AppRevealView';

export const ExpoCameraDemo = () => {
  const [showCamera, setShowCamera] = useState(false);
  return (
    <MobilePhoneView safeAreaPaddingTop={0}>
      {showCamera ? (
        <AppRevealView>
          <Camera style={{ flex: 1, width: '100%' }} />
        </AppRevealView>
      ) : (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center' }}>
          <AppButton
            onPress={async () => {
              const result = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA);
              if (result.status === 'granted') {
                setShowCamera(true);
              }
            }}
          >
            Show expo-camera
          </AppButton>
        </View>
      )}
    </MobilePhoneView>
  );
};
```

------------------------------------------------


I hope this post helps you understand that cross-platform works fine for various kind of experiences, and there are very few things that you can't do in a cross-platform way today. Let's build more of these!

I'll update this post regularly, if I find new interesting cross-platform experiences (feel free to give me ideas).

# Toward cross-platform MDX content authoring

All these demos use React Native and Expo code, and they can run natively on React-Native.
These demos are embedded in this markdown post using [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx).
Fortunately, MDX can be run on React-Native too!

This actually means that... **my posts are cross-platform**?

Stay tuned: in upcoming blog posts, I'll show you how I run my MDX blog posts inside an Expo app.
