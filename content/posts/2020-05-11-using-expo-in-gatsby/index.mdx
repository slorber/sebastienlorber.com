You probably heard of [React-Native-Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web), allowing to render **React-Native views on the web**.

**So, what about using React-Native in a Gatsby website?**

This post is a **proof-of-concept**: it contains **React-Native** and **Expo** interactive components, embedded directly into [this article](https://github.com/slorber/sebastienlorber.com/tree/master/content/posts/2020-05-11-using-expo-in-gatsby) (using [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)), of my [open-source](https://github.com/slorber/sebastienlorber.com) Gatsby site.

If you are not familiar with the React-Native ecosystem:

- **React-Native-Web**: it is like a CSS-in-JS library (similar to Emotion or styled-components) that reuse the existing React-Native APIs. It has interesting properties (like [atomic CSS-in-JS](https://sebastienlorber.com/atomic-css-in-js)).
- **Expo**: it is like an extension of React-Native: it provides a large SDK with much more APIs than core React-Native (camera, battery, video, audio, qrcode...), enabling you to build more complex experiences.

The idea is that I can use such code in my Gatsby site:

```jsx
import { TouchableOpacity, Text } from 'react-native';

export const MyTestButton = () => (
  <TouchableOpacity
    onPress={() => alert('onPress')}
    style={{
      padding: 10,
      backgroundColor: 'blue',
      borderRadius: 5,
    }}
  >
    <Text style={{ color: 'white' }}>Click me</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
);
```

And it should work fine in my Gatsby pages, but also in MDX content:

```mdx
# Blog title

blabla this is a MDX blog post using an embedded RN button:

import { TouchableOpacity, Text } from 'react-native';

<TouchableOpacity
  onPress={() => alert('press')}
  style={{
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    borderRadius: 5,
  }}
>
  <Text style={{ color: 'white' }}>Click me</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

Let's run this `Hello world` code and see if it works:

import { TouchableOpacity, Text } from 'react-native';
import MobilePhoneView from 'components/MobilePhoneView';

<MobilePhoneView
  style={{ alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}
>
  <TouchableOpacity
    onPress={() => alert("You thought it wouldn't work?")}
    style={{
      padding: 10,
      backgroundColor: 'blue',
      borderRadius: 5,
    }}
  >
    <Text style={{ color: 'white' }}>Click me</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
</MobilePhoneView>

# Why ???

- blogging about React-Native
- cross-platform: sharing code between your mobile app and a static website
- using React-Native-Web, as it's a performant [atomic CSS-in-JS](https://sebastienlorber.com/atomic-css-in-js) library

I have good hope to see more React-Native developers embed **runnable code** in their blogs, like I did in this post.

# Demo time

Keep in mind that all the demos are written in a cross-platform way, using only React-Native and Expo apis.

All these demos can also run (natively) in iOS and Android (natively).

There's no usage of a single `div`, or any direct browser or DOM api usage.

import {
  ExpoCameraDemo,
  ExpoDarkModeSwitchDemo,
  ExpoGesturesDemo,
  ExpoSvgDemo,
  ExpoVideoDemo,
  ExpoImagePickerDemo,
} from './components';

So, let's start with a simple one.
Can I render a complex svg with react-native-svg? Yes!

<ExpoSvgDemo />

---

Can I use a cross-platform third-party component, like [expo-dark-mode-switch](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-dark-mode-switch), and wire it to my Gatsby theme-ui state? Yes!

<ExpoDarkModeSwitchDemo />

---

Can I ask your permission to use your camera, and reveal it with a fade-in animation? Yes!

<ExpoCameraDemo />

---

Can I use more complex gesture-based systems? Yes! Demo credits to Evan Bacon.

<ExpoGesturesDemo />

---

Can I play a video? Yes!

<ExpoVideoDemo />

---

Can I build an image picker, and enable a few image transformations? Yes!

<ExpoImagePickerDemo />

---

In case you wonder what the code looks like, here's a snippet for the camera demo.

You can find the rest of the code [here](https://github.com/slorber/sebastienlorber.com/tree/master/content/posts/2020-05-11-using-expo-in-gatsby).

```jsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';

import MobilePhoneView from 'components/MobilePhoneView';
import AppButton from 'components/designSystem/AppButton';
import AppRevealView from 'components/designSystem/AppRevealView';

export const ExpoCameraDemo = () => {
  const [showCamera, setShowCamera] = useState(false);
  return (
    <MobilePhoneView safeAreaPaddingTop={0}>
      {showCamera ? (
        <AppRevealView>
          <Camera style={{ flex: 1, width: '100%' }} />
        </AppRevealView>
      ) : (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center' }}>
          <AppButton
            onPress={async () => {
              const result = await Permissions.askAsync(
                Permissions.CAMERA,
              );
              if (result.status === 'granted') {
                setShowCamera(true);
              }
            }}
          >
            Show expo-camera
          </AppButton>
        </View>
      )}
    </MobilePhoneView>
  );
};
```

# gatsby-plugin-react-native-web v3

I created [gatsby-plugin-react-native-web](https://github.com/slorber/gatsby-plugin-react-native-web), and **version 3.0 is now out of beta**.

It uses under the hood [@expo/webpack-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/webpack-config), which permit to get started fast without any config (thanks [Evan Bacon](https://twitter.com/baconbrix)).

**Note**: you can use [React-Native and Expo with NextJS](https://dev.to/evanbacon/next-js-expo-and-react-native-for-web-3kd9) too. [Evanbacon.dev](http://evanbacon.dev/) is build with NextJS and Expo. You can use [@expo/webpack-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/webpack-config) on any project using Webpack.

After adding the required dependencies, you only need to add the plugin to `gatsby-config.js`, and **nothing else is required** (0 plugin config to provide).
This blog post does not need any fancy additional config to render properly.
Expo APIs, and your favorite React-Native libs, should work out of the box.

The best way to get started is to use the new [Gatsby Recipes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-04-15-announcing-gatsby-recipes/) feature:

```
gatsby recipes https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slorber/gatsby-plugin-react-native-web/master/recipe.mdx
```

Otherwise you can do these steps manually

### Step 1

Add required dependencies to `package.json`

```
yarn add react-native react-native-web@~0.11.7 gatsby-plugin-react-native-web
```

If you want to use Expo APIs, and advanced animations, you can install these too:

```
yarn add expo react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
```

### Step 2

Add the plugin in `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-react-native-web`],
};
```

### Step 3

Use React-Native and Expo components in your Gatsby site.

Check the React-Native-Web and Expo docs for available web platform support.

You can also browse libraries with web support on [reactnative.directory](https://reactnative.directory/?web=true).

# Toward cross-platform content

All these demos use React Native and Expo code, and they can run natively on React-Native, because they only rely on React-Native primitives.
These demos are embedded in this markdown post using [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx).
Fortunately, MDX can be run on React-Native too!

This actually means that... **my posts are cross-platform**?

Stay tuned: in upcoming blog posts, I'll show you how I run my cross-platform MDX blog posts inside an Expo app.

For a preview, scan my [Expo QRCode](https://expo.io/@slorber/sebastien-lorber), or take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/slorber/sebastienlorber.com) :)

# Conclusion

We need more people to adopt cross-platform development, to make it mainstream and polished.

The setup to get started has never been so simple, it's time to jump on the bandwagon, and get started with React-Native-Web.

Thank you for reading!
